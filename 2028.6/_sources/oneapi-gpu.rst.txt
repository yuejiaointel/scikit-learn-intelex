##############################################################
oneAPI and GPU support in |sklearnex|
##############################################################

|sklearnex| can execute computations on different devices (CPUs, GPUs) through the SYCL framework in oneAPI.

The device used for computations can be easily controlled through the target offloading functionality (e.g. through ``sklearnex.config_context(target_offload="gpu")`` - see rest of this page for more details), but for finer-grained controlled (e.g. operating on arrays that are already in a given device's memory), it can also interact with objects from package |dpctl|, which offers a Python interface over SYCL concepts such as devices, queues, and USM (unified shared memory) arrays.

While not strictly required, package |dpctl| is recommended for a better experience on GPUs.

.. important:: Be aware that GPU usage requires non-Python dependencies on your system, such as the `Intel(R) GPGPU Drivers <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/system-requirements/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-system-requirements.html>`_.

Prerequisites
-------------

For execution on GPUs, DPC++ runtime and GPGPU drivers are required.

DPC++ compiler runtime can be installed either from PyPI or Conda:

- Install from PyPI::

     pip install dpcpp-cpp-rt

- Install using Conda from Intel's repository::

     conda install -c https://software.repos.intel.com/python/conda/ dpcpp_cpp_rt

- Install using Conda from the conda-forge channel::

     conda install -c conda-forge dpcpp_cpp_rt

For GPGPU driver installation instructions, see the general `DPC++ system requirements <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/system-requirements/intel-oneapi-dpcpp-system-requirements.html>`_ sections corresponding to your operating system.

Device offloading
-----------------

|sklearnex| offers two options for running an algorithm on a specified device:

- Use global configurations of |sklearnex|\*:

  1. The :code:`target_offload` argument (in ``config_context`` and in ``set_config`` / ``get_config``)
     can be used to set the device primarily used to perform computations. Accepted data types are
     :code:`str` and :obj:`dpctl.SyclQueue`. Strings must match to device names recognized by
     the SYCL* device filter selector - for example, ``"gpu"``. If passing ``"auto"``,
     the device will be deduced from the location of the input data. Examples:

     .. code-block:: python
        
        from sklearnex import config_context
        from sklearnex.linear_model import LinearRegression
        
        with config_context(target_offload="gpu"):
            model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)

     .. code-block:: python
        
        from sklearnex import set_config
        from sklearnex.linear_model import LinearRegression
        
        set_config(target_offload="gpu")
        model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)


     If passing a string different than ``"auto"``,
     it must be a device 

  2. The :code:`allow_fallback_to_host` argument in those same configuration functions
     is a Boolean flag. If set to :code:`True`, the computation is allowed
     to fallback to the host device when a particular estimator does not support
     the selected device. The default value is :code:`False`.

These options can be set using :code:`sklearnex.set_config()` function or
:code:`sklearnex.config_context`. To obtain the current values of these options,
call :code:`sklearnex.get_config()`.

.. note::
     Functions :code:`set_config`, :code:`get_config` and :code:`config_context`
     are always patched after the :code:`sklearnex.patch_sklearn()` call.

- Pass input data as :obj:`dpctl.tensor.usm_ndarray` to the algorithm.

  The computation will run on the device where the input data is
  located, and the result will be returned as :code:`usm_ndarray` to the same
  device.

  .. note::
    All the input data for an algorithm must reside on the same device.

  .. warning::
    The :code:`usm_ndarray` can only be consumed by the base methods
    like :code:`fit`, :code:`predict`, and :code:`transform`.
    Note that only the algorithms in |sklearnex| support
    :code:`usm_ndarray`. The algorithms from the stock version of |sklearn|
    do not support this feature.


Example
-------

A full example of how to patch your code with Intel CPU/GPU optimizations:

.. code-block:: python

   from sklearnex import patch_sklearn, config_context
   patch_sklearn()

   from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN

   X = np.array([[1., 2.], [2., 2.], [2., 3.],
                 [8., 7.], [8., 8.], [25., 80.]], dtype=np.float32)
   with config_context(target_offload="gpu:0"):
      clustering = DBSCAN(eps=3, min_samples=2).fit(X)


.. note:: Current offloading behavior restricts fitting and predictions (a.k.a. inference) of any models to be
     in the same context or absence of context. For example, a model whose ``.fit()`` method was called in a GPU context with
     ``target_offload="gpu:0"`` will throw an error if a ``.predict()`` call is then made outside the same GPU context.
