Quick Start
####################

Get ready to elevate your |sklearn| code with |sklearnex| and experience the benefits of accelerated performance in just a few simple steps.

Compatibility with Scikit-learn*
---------------------------------

|sklearnex| is compatible with the latest stable releases of |sklearn| - see :ref:`software-requirements` for more details.

Integrate |sklearnex|
----------------------

.. _patching:

Patching
**********************

Once you install the |sklearnex|, you can replace estimator classes (algorithms) that exist in the ``sklearn`` module from |sklearn| with their optimized versions from the extension.
This action is called `patching` or `monkey patching <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch>`__. This is not a permanent change so you can always undo the patching if necessary.

To patch |sklearn| with the |sklearnex|, the following methods can be used:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left

   * - Method
     - Action
   * - Use a flag in the command line
     - Run this command:

       ::

          python -m sklearnex my_application.py
   * - Modify your script
     - Add the following lines:

       ::

          from sklearnex import patch_sklearn
          patch_sklearn()
   * - Import an estimator from the ``sklearnex`` module
     - Run this command:

       ::

          from sklearnex.neighbors import NearestNeighbors



These patching methods are interchangeable.
They support different enabling scenarios while producing the same result.


**Example**

This example shows how to patch |sklearn| by modifing your script. To make sure that patching is registered by the scikit-learn estimators, always import module ``sklearn`` after these lines.

.. code-block:: python
  :caption: Example: Drop-In Patching

    import numpy as np
    from sklearnex import patch_sklearn
    patch_sklearn()

    # You need to re-import scikit-learn algorithms after the patch
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

    # The use of the original Scikit-learn is not changed
    X = np.array([[1,  2], [1,  4], [1,  0],
                  [10, 2], [10, 4], [10, 0]])
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0).fit(X)
    print(f"kmeans.labels_ = {kmeans.labels_}")


Global Patching
**********************

You can also use global patching to patch all your |sklearn| applications without any additional actions.

Before you begin, make sure that you have read and write permissions for Scikit-learn files.

With global patching, you can:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left

   * - Task
     - Action
     - Note
   * - Patch all supported algorithms
     - Run this command:

       ::

          python -m sklearnex.glob patch_sklearn

     - If you run the global patching command several times with different parameters, then only the last configuration is applied.
   * - Patch selected algorithms
     - Use ``--algorithm`` or ``-a`` keys with a list of algorithms to patch. For example, to patch only ``SVC`` and ``RandomForestClassifier`` estimators, run

       ::

           python -m sklearnex.glob patch_sklearn -a svc random_forest_classifier

     -
   * - Enable global patching via code
     - Use the ``patch_sklearn`` function with the ``global_patch`` argument:

       ::

          from sklearnex import patch_sklearn
          patch_sklearn(global_patch=True)
          import sklearn

     - After that, Scikit-learn patches is enabled in the current application and in all others that use the same environment.
   * - Disable patching notifications
     - Use ``--no-verbose`` or ``-nv`` keys:

       ::

          python -m sklearnex.glob patch_sklearn -a svc random_forest_classifier -nv
     -
   * - Disable global patching
     - Run this command:

       ::

          python -m sklearnex.glob unpatch_sklearn
     -
   * - Disable global patching via code
     - Use the ``global_patch`` argument in the ``unpatch_sklearn`` function

       ::

          from sklearnex import unpatch_sklearn
          unpatch_sklearn(global_patch=True)
     -

.. tip:: If you clone an environment with enabled global patching, it will already be applied in the new environment.

Unpatching
**********************

To undo the patch (also called `unpatching`) is to return the ``sklearn`` module to the original implementation and
replace patched estimators with the stock |sklearn| estimators.

To unpatch successfully, you must reimport the ``sklearn`` module(s)::

  sklearnex.unpatch_sklearn()
  # Re-import scikit-learn algorithms after the unpatch
  from sklearn.cluster import KMeans


Installation
--------------------

.. contents:: :local:

.. tip:: To prevent version conflicts, we recommend creating and activating a new environment for |sklearnex|.

Install from PyPI
**********************

Recommended by default.

To install |sklearnex|, run:

::

  pip install scikit-learn-intelex

**Supported Configurations**

.. list-table::
   :align: left

   * - Operating systems

|sklearnex| is compatible with the latest stable releases of |sklearn|:

* 1.0.X
* 1.1.X
* 1.2.X
* 1.3.X
* 1.4.X
* 1.5.X
* 1.6.X

Memory Requirements
**********************
By default, algorithms in |sklearnex| run in the multi-thread mode. This mode uses all available threads.
Optimized scikit-learn estimators can consume more RAM than their corresponding unoptimized versions.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :align: left

   * - Algorithm
     - Single-thread mode
     - Multi-thread mode
   * - SVM
     - Both |sklearn| and |sklearnex| consume approximately the same amount of RAM.
     - In |sklearnex|, an algorithm with ``N`` threads consumes ``N`` times more RAM.

In all |sklearnex| algorithms with GPU support, computations run on device memory.
The device memory must be large enough to store a copy of the entire dataset.
You may also require additional device memory for internal arrays that are used in computation.
